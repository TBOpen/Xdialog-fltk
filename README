# Xdialog-fltk
Port of Xdialog to FLTK

---------------------------------------
Current State - Work In Progress (WIP)
---------------------------------------

The initial port was done through freelancer.com but the results were not 
acceptable for release.

It is based on Xdialog 2.3.1

What has been done so far:

1)	Separated the single .cpp file provided back in to separate modules.
2)	Removed the commented out code.
3)	Started adding and correcting fundamental functions such as font_init() 
    and set_window_size_and_placement()

This was only added to a public repository (at this time) for others to use 
to reproduce issues found using FLTK 1.4 currently in development.
